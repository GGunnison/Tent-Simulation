%
%  This function takes a file containing weather information in the
%  format and units of the example file (June2014weatherdata.txt) and
%  averages the values appriopriately for use with the MILP optimization
%  routine.  Note that it begins from the first line of data.
%
%  Inputs:  (1)  file = full path of weather file
%           (2)  st  = starting time for data collection (s)
%           (3)  n    = planning horizon (s)
%           (4)  t    = timestep in planning horizon (s)
%           (5)  plt  = flag to print or not print data
%
%  Output:  (1)  Tx   = n/t+1 array of outside air temperatures
%           (2)  qsol = n/t+1 array of solar irradiation
%           (3)  time = n/t_1 array of file timestamp (s)
